## Goals

* Join one of the Chingu cohorts that @tropicalchancer puts together and actively participate on one or more group projects
* Goal: Contribute one pull request per month to an open source project of your choosing.
* When you're working through a book, type out the example code and do all the exercises.
* When you're working through a course, do all the assignments.
* When you're building a Project, include a built process (like [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)), include at least 5 automated tests ([Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html), [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), sinon, chai, jasmine, tape, whatever works for you), include a README.md file that clearly explains the project, and practice using [meaningful 
commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) 
* Use each project to demonstrate that you can deliver an optimized product. Implement tests (as I mentioned above), use your build process to minimize assets, use a linter (like [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)) on your JavaScript and have some method to your madness when it comes to your css naming conventions (like [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/))
